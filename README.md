**Movie Ticket Purchasing Platform**
The platform is designed for users to see different movies from  different cinema chains, with multiple movie screening hours in  multiple screenings.
They can buy their ticket and additionally they  can buy some snacks with their ticket.
Moreover, when a new movie is added to the platform, the user that has been subscribed to platform will get a notification for it.
 Design patterns we intend to use are Decorator Pattern for calculating the ticket and snack cost, Factory Method Pattern for showing different movie theatres of different cinema chains in 
multiple cities and Observer Pattern for sending notification to subscribed users.
